# How to contribute

Contributions to this project are highly encouraged and desired.
Below are some guidelines that will help make the process as smooth as possible.

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
- Submit a new issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  - Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  - Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
- Fork the repository on GitHub

## Suggesting Enhancements

I want to know what you think is missing from this project and how it can be made better.

- When submitting an issue for an enhancement, please be as clear as possible about why you think the enhancement is needed and what the benefit of it would be for you personally, and for the broader community.

## Making Changes

- From your fork of the repository, create a topic branch where work on your change will take place.
- To quickly create a topic branch based on main; `git checkout -b my_contribution main`.
  Please avoid working directly on the `main` branch.
- Make commits of logical units.
- Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
- Please follow the prevailing code conventions in the repository.
  Differences in style make the code harder to understand for everyone.
- Make sure your commit messages are brief and descriptive. The [Conventional Commits Specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) provides a great framework.

    feat: Add more cowbell to Get-Something.ps1
    
    The functionality of Get-Something would be greatly improved if there was a little
    more 'pizzazz' added to it. I propose a cowbell. Adding more cowbell has been
    shown in studies to both increase one's mojo, and cement one's status
    as a rock legend.    
```

- If the repository implements tests, please make sure you have added all the necessary tests for your changes and that all tests pass. You are welcome to ask for advice or help in the GitHub issue associated with your changes.
